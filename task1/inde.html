    <p style="font-size: 20px;">Unsweetened Chocolate: Also known as pure chocolate, this type contains cocoa solids and cocoa butter in varying proportions. It lacks added sugar, making it intensely rich and slightly bitter. Imagine a velvety, dark slab of pure cocoa goodness! üç´!
        Chocolate is made from the seeds of the cocoa tree that are dried and crushed. The origin of the cacao tree is from Mexico, the cocoa beans have a slightly bitter taste. Chocolate is a mixture of cocoa powder and cocoa butter, to which sugar, milk, and other substances are added, and finally packed into bars. Chocolate can also be made into a drink (called cocoa or hot chocolate).
